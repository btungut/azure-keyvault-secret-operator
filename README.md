# Azure KeyVault Secret Operator
Easy to use operator which is able to **sync all of the Azure KeyVault contents** into your Kubernetes cluster with **only one manifest**. 

All you need to have a **Service Principal** which is used to access **Azure KeyVault**.
Operator can run on non Azure environments without any kind of other prerequisites like CSI driver, ARC enabling, etc.
